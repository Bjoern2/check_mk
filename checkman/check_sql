description:
This is an active check that connects to a database server, sends an SQL
statement to that server, and checks for the following result:

The query must return three columns, a number, a text, and 
performance data in the third column.
If upper and lower levels are given, the number is being checked
against these levels and the according state is being computed. 
Otherwise the number ist treated as a Nagios state (0,1,2,3).
State, text and the performance data are being returned

The check works with MySQL, Postgresql and Oracle databases using the
python drivers MySQLdb, psycopg2 and cx_Oracle. For cx_Oracle the
Oracle instantclient needs to be installed as well, and the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be modified to point to the libclntsh.so of 
that package.

perfdata:
 One value: the third field of the database response.
