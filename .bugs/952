Title: Livestatus: parse DOWNTIMESTOPPED (UP) into correct state UP
Component: livestatus
State: open
Date: 2013-09-16 11:34:56
Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: nastiness

When parsing lines like:

[1379282400] HOST NOTIFICATION: mk;Lehrerrechner;check-mk-notify;DOWNTIMESTOPPED (UP);mk

Livestatus sets 3 as the state (meaning invalid). It should extract the (UP) however
and set the state 0.
