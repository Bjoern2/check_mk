Title: CUPS print queue monitoring: Default Printer is not checked / inventorized
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2013-09-16 08:52:34
Targetversion: 1.2.3i2
Class: bug

after a change in the linux agent, all printers are monitored / inventorized
except the default printer, having a
<DefaultPrinter sw>
section in /etc/cups/printers.conf

execution time optimization can be done within the change:
lpstat -a
command should not be executed twice, but only once
(whereas the lpstat -p and lpstat -o commands can be done once per printer)
